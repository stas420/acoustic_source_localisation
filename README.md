# matlab_sim

Here I keep MATLAB 2025Rb code of ASL algos simulations:
- Delay-and-Sum  *(in progress)*
- SRP-PHAT
- MUSIC 
- MVDR adaptive beamforming  *(in progress)*
- Maximum Entropy/Maximum Likelihood  *(TODO)*

Used toolboxes:
- Audio Toolbox
- DSP Toolbox
- Phased Array Toolbox
- Communications Toolbox (*to be verified*)

# srp_phat_impl

In this directory you're gonna find my PoC implementation of SRP-PHAT algorithm in C, running on PC device with **[kissfft](https://github.com/mborgerding/kissfft)** library.

How I build it (on Windows):

```
cd {parent_dirs}\srp_phat_impl
mkdir .\build
cd .\build
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc ..
mingw32-make
.\program.exe
```

On Linux you'd probably want to do it the same way, but run `cmake` as usual and use usual `make` command.

`ura_rx.txt` and `mics.txt` files are generated by Matlab simulations from `matlab_sim` directory, and used as test input.

# stm_code

In this directory, an STM32CubeIDE project is held. This is a complete code for STM32 H563ZI (ARM Cortex M33) for data acquisition from 16 mics from dedicated FPGA through SPI, and for DoA calculations based on that. It uses **[CMSIS-DSP](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-DSP)** precompiled library for maths and Q31 arithmetics, which is included in `/Drivers/CMSIS/DSP`. 

*It, then, will transmit estimated DoA angles through UART to connected PC with dedicated Python script.* <-- TODO

### how to build: 

1. install STM32CubeIDE
2. open `stm_code` as a workspace
3. inside the workspace open/import this project 
4. check, just to be sure, the build configuration:
    - in the project tree: *asl_demo* -> right-click -> Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Tool Settings -> MCU/MPU GCC Compiler -> Include paths -> Include paths (-I) -- there should be an entry like `"${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/Drivers/CMSIS/DSP/Include}"`
    - in the project tree: *asl_demo* -> right-click -> Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Tool Settings -> MCU/MPU GCC Linker -> Libraries:
        - in Library search, there should be an entry like `"${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/Drivers/CMSIS/DSP/Lib}"`
        - in Libraries, there should be an entry like `CMSISDSP`
5. to check the build only: *asl_demo.ioc* -> right-click -> build project
6. to deploy on the device: connect STM32 device to the PC through USB-C -> in CubeIDE, click "Run"
7. to deploy with debugger: connect STM32 device to the PC through USB-C -> in CubeIDE, click "Debug" 
    - if you want breakpoints, double click on the line number, where you want the debugger to stop
    - if you want to check some global variables, in Expressions tab just insert the variable name
